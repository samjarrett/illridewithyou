				We ask the State Governments of Australia and its Ministers for Transport to pledge their support for a
				national #illridewithyou campaign and make Friday, January 16 a fare-free day for all.
			</strong></p>

			<p><strong>
				In return, we&rsquo;ll help raise $1 million for the families devastated by the events of the siege on
				Sydney&rsquo;s Martin Place, and contribute to funding for anti-discrimination projects throughout Australia.
			</strong></p>

			<p>
				On the morning of Tuesday, December 16, the nation awoke to tragedy. During the early hours, two
				innocent people lost their lives. A third was lost, and we will never know the true motives of this
				lone gunman.
			</p>

			<p>
				The entire nation sat shocked as its worst fears were realised. All were devastated, many angry, and
				plenty left confused. Emotions were charged, at times misdirected. People were scared.
			</p>

			<p>
				But despite all this darkness, the light shone through.
			</p>

			<p>
				The actions of one human on a Sydney train restored the faith of another. Of a nation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Her actions sparked perhaps one of the most overwhelming displays of global citizenry this nation has
				ever seen. #illridewith you spread across borders, transcended cultural barriers and reached all corners
				of the world.
			</p>

			<p>
				When all else seemed lost, the world suddenly had hope again.

				We need the support of the global community to achieve tangible outcomes for problems that we face in
				society. Throughout 2014 we have seen the impact that ignorance and intolerance of diversity has on
				individuals and communities alike. We have seen that persecution on the basis of race or religion breeds
				nothing but fear, anger and hatred.
			</p>

			<p>
				As part of this, we have observed numerous examples of disturbing conduct being directed at commuters on
				the nation&rsquo;s public transport systems.
			</p>

			<p>
				We are assuming responsibility for launching this campaign in the hope that Australians to support the
				positive messages that have emerged from the tragic events in Martin Place.
			</p>

			<p><strong>
				We have proposed to The Honorary Gladys Berejiklian and Jacinta Allen respectively, that if we can raise
				$1 million within one month, they, along with the states&rsquo; public transport operators will declare
				January 16 to be a fare-free day for all commuters in the greater metropolitan areas of Sydney and
				Melbourne.
			</strong></p>

			<p>
				We believe everyone, regardless of race, faith or political belief can band together, ride together. 
				We can encourage diversity and positive response to this far-reaching heartbreak. Our greatest strength 
				is in unity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our goal is ambitious, but we are up for the challenge. All we ask for is your support.

				We pledge to donate 50% of funds raised to the families of those most deeply affected by the shocking
				events that threatened to tear this nation apart. The other 50% will be donated directly to projects
				aimed at defeating discrimination in Australia.
			</p>

			<p>
				So join us, take the pledge. Let&rsquo;s ride together.
